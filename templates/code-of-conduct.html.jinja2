    <section>
      <h3>Enforcement Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
        standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair
        corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem
        inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
        reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
        contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will
        communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also
        applies when an individual is officially representing the community in
        public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an
        official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account,
        or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Enforcement</h3>
      <p>
        Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
        be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement
        at <a href="mailto:contact&#64;courtbouillon.org">contact&#64;courtbouillon.org</a>.
        All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
      </p>
      <p>
        All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security
        of the reporter of any incident.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Enforcement Guidelines</h3>
      <p>
        Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in
        determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of
        this Code of Conduct:
      </p>

      <h4>Correction</h4>
      <p>
        Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior
        deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders,
        providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation
        of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be
        requested.
      </p>

      <h4>Warning</h4>
      <p>
        Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of
        actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
        interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
        with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of
        time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well
        as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead
        to a temporary or permanent ban.
      </p>

      <h4>Temporary Ban</h4>
      <p>
        Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including
        sustained inappropriate behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
        communication with the community for a specified period of time. No
        public or private interaction with the people involved, including
        unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is
        allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a
        permanent ban.
      </p>

      <h4>Permanent Ban</h4>
      <p>
        Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
        standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
        individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of
        individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
        the community.
