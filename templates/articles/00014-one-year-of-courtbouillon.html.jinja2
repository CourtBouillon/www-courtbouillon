      <h3>Software Progress</h3>

      <p>
        So what did happened on the different projects during the past year? Were
        there some releases? Some bug fixes? Some new features? Or nothing at all?
        Let‚Äôs have a look üßê!
      </p>

      <h4>Issues</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/one_year_issues.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        301 issues were closed, of which 243 were on WeasyPrint.
      </p>

      <h4>Pull Requests</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/one_year_pr.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        37 pull requests have been merged, of which 15 were on WeasyPrint.
      </p>

      <h4>Releases</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/one_year_releases.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        26 releases have been made, of which 12 for WeasyPrint.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to all people who opened issues and submited pull requests üíú.
      </p>

      <h4>Features</h4>
      <p>
        During the year, WeasyPrint had a big change. We stoped using Cairo to
        generate PDF and we replaced it by our own PDF generator, <a href="https://github.com/CourtBouillon/pydyf">
        pydyf</a>. So now, WeasyPrint requires one less non-Python dependency,
        which means the installation is a bit easier and bugs caused by Cairo are
        now in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, WeasyPrint got new interesting features like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>support basic inline SVG,</li>
        <li>include full sets of fonts in PDF,</li>
        <li>leaders support,</li>
        <li>line-clamp support,</li>
        <li>optimization of embedded images size‚Ä¶</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It has been a pretty big year for the different projects, specially for
        WeasyPrint üéâ!

      <h3>Sponsoring Campaign and Sponsors</h3>

      <p>
        All of this work wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without all people who has

        our OpenCollective campaign</a>.
      </p>
      <p>

        secure half a day per week exclusively to improve software!
      </p>
      <p>
        That‚Äôs not the only source of income.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, there are companies who sponsored the development of some features.
        Thanks to them, we have been able to dedicate more time on the software
        and brang to everyone <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues?q=label%3Asponsored+is%3Aclosed">

      <h3>And For Next Year?</h3>

      <p>
        So that was kind of the assessment for the past year.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you‚Äôre at least as happy as us of what happened on the software
        and that our work is useful for you üòä.

      <p>
        For the next year, we‚Äôre going to continue improving the different projects,

        idea of what is coming on the next releases for WeasyPrint on <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/milestones">
        this GitHub page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>

        source, CSS or other topics; like with <a href="{{ url_for('blog', article='00011-the-python-packaging-hell-the-can-of-worms') }}">
        the new serie of articles about packaging</a>.
