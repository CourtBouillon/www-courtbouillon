      <h3>CourtBouillon‚Äôs Birth</h3>

      <p>
        Last year, on the same day as today, <a href="https://twitter.com/BouillonCourt/status/1315588318042693632">we announced the creation of
        CourtBouillon</a>.

      <h3>Software Progress</h3>

      <p>
        So, what did happen on the different projects during the past year?
        Were there some releases? Some bug fixes? Some new features? Or nothing
        at all? Let‚Äôs have a look üßê!
      </p>

      <h4>Closed Issues</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/one_year_issues.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        301 issues were closed, of which 243 were on WeasyPrint.
      </p>

      <h4>Merged Pull Requests</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/one_year_pr.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        37 pull requests have been merged, of which 15 were on WeasyPrint.
      </p>

      <h4>Releases</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/one_year_releases.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        26 releases have been made, of which 12 for WeasyPrint.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to all the people who opened issues and submitted pull requests
        üíú.
      </p>

      <h4>Features</h4>
      <p>
        During the year, WeasyPrint had a big change: we stopped using Cairo to
        generate PDF, and replaced it by our own PDF generator: <a href="https://github.com/CourtBouillon/pydyf">
        pydyf</a>. Now, WeasyPrint requires one less non-Python dependency,
        which means that the installation is a bit easier and that bugs caused
        by Cairo are now in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        WeasyPrint also got new interesting features like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>basic inline SVG support,</li>
        <li>full fonts inclusion,</li>
        <li>leaders support,</li>
        <li>line-clamp support,</li>
        <li>embedded images size optimization,</li>
        <li>and more‚Ä¶</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It has been a pretty big year for the different projects, especially for
        WeasyPrint üéâ!

      <h3>Sponsoring Campaign and Sponsors</h3>

      <p>
        All this work wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the people who have
        participated and still participate to <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">
        our OpenCollective campaign</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In one year, the OpenCollective campaign yielded 5‚ÄØ307‚Ç¨, allowing us to
        secure half a day per week exclusively working for CourtBouillon!
      </p>
      <p>
        That‚Äôs not our only source of income.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, companies sponsored the development of some features. Thanks to
        them, we have been able to dedicate more time on the software and
        brought <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues?q=label%3Asponsored+is%3Aclosed">
        new cool features</a> to everyone ü§©.
      </p>

      <p>
        We‚Äôre very proud and pleased to have people and companies sponsoring us, and happy
        with our first year as CourtBouillon üíú.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the moment, we can‚Äôt work full-time yet on improving the different
        projects, but we count on you to <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">
        support us</a> to reach this goal!
      </p>

      <h3>And For the Next Year?</h3>

      <p>
        We hope that you‚Äôre as happy as we are about the progress this year,
        and that our work is useful for you üòä.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the next year, we‚Äôre going to continue improving the different projects,
        focusing on <a href="{{ url_for('blog', article='00010-weasyprint-survey-2021') }}">the most wanted features</a>. If you‚Äôre curious, you can have an
        idea of what is coming for the next releases of WeasyPrint on <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/milestones">
        this GitHub page</a> (please note that the content of the milestones isn‚Äôt
        fixed and might change).
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, we would like to create some content to talk about Python, open
        source, CSS and other topics. You can for example discover <a href="{{ url_for('blog', article='00011-the-python-packaging-hell-the-can-of-worms') }}">
        the new serie of articles about packaging</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs it for this one year rewind of CourtBouillon!
      </p>
      <p>
        To all of our sponsors, users and contributors: thank you üíú.
