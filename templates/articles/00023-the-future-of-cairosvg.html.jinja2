      <h2>The Future Of CairoSVG</h2>
      <aside><time datetime="2022-05-19">May 19, 2022</time>, by grewn0uille</aside>
      <p>
        After some times of doubts and questionning about the future of CairoSVG, we made
        a survey to know what the current users would like and except.
        This article presents the results of this survey and what is coming for CairoSVG.
      </p>

      <h3>Why a survey?</h3>

      <p>
        For a long time, CairoSVG was used by WeasyPrint while it was relying on cairo
        to render SVG, PNG and PDF. Cairo is nice but it brang some limitations and bugs
        in WeasyPrint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of these bugs and limitations, we remove this cairo dependency from
        WeasyPrint by developing our own <a href="{{ url_for('blog', article='000008-weasyprint-53-beta') }}">low-level PDF engine</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this big change in WeasyPrint, we donâ€™t really use CairoSVG anymore,
        and so, we didnâ€™t know what to do with this project or what would be nice
        to have when using CairoSVG.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can have some ideas by looking at the GitHubâ€™s issues, but it doesnâ€™t
        really reflect the majority of users. Thus, we decided to made a survey to
        ask directly to these users ðŸ”Ž.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what answers did we get from this survey?
      </p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <h4>How long have you been using CairoSVG?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q1.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        CairoSVG has been a dependency of WeasyPrint for a long time, so itâ€™s
        not very surprising to have a part of the users knowing about and using
        since long. Itâ€™s more surprising to have recent users as the project
        hadnâ€™t new features since quite a time.
      </p>

      <h4>In which context do you use CairoSVG?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q2.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Most a people uses CairoSVG in a professional context, but itâ€™s
        interesting to see that some are using it in a personl context.
      </p>

      <h4>Why did you choose to use CairoSVG, compared to other SVG conversion libraries?</h4>
      <p>
        Users like to use CairoSVG because itâ€™s ease to use, fast, you can have a
        good control on what youâ€™re doing and because itâ€™s because itâ€™s
        open source.
      </p>

      <h4>In which format do you convert your SVG images with CairoSVG?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q3.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Itâ€™s funny to see that a large part of the users are using
        CairoSVG to convert SVG into SVG. This feature had been
        developped as a joke as the goal of CairoSVG is to convert
        SVG into other formats ðŸ˜„.
      </p>

      <h4>On which OS do you use CairoSVG?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q4.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Linux is the main OS on which CairoSVG is used, but there is a
        significant part on Windows too.
      </p>

      <h4>What would you expect from CairoSVG in the future?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q5.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        The majority of the users expects bug fixes for CairoSVG. Itâ€™s also
        quite funny to see people are expecting nothing in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the comments, CairoSVG users would also like to see CairoSVG
        maintained with recent Python versions and have a long life.
      </p>

      <h4>Would you like to use another library?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q6.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Most people arenâ€™t really into using something else than
        CairoSVG, but some seems to be willing to at least try something
        else.
      </p>

      <h4>Would WeasyPrint+GhostScript be a solution for you?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q7.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        The answer is kind of clear, WeasyPrint + Ghostscript wouldnâ€™t be
        a solution to replace the usage of CairoSVG.
      </p>

      <h4>Would you be ready to pay for new features or bug fixes?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q8.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Only 12.5% would be ready to pay for new features or bug fixes.
        While 75% wouldnâ€™t like that.
      </p>

      <h3>Whatâ€™s Next</h3>

      <p>
        First, weâ€™d like to thanks all people who took time to answer the
        survey ðŸ’œ. It really helped us to have a clearer view and to take
        a decision about what weâ€™re going to do for the future of CairoSVG.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before talking about the future (so much suspense), weâ€™d like to
        talk a bit more of this survey and not its results.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we created it and looked for CairoSVG issues on GitHub to
        communicate about the survey, we realised that in fact, there arenâ€™t
        so much new issues. The more recents are from 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we were surprised by the number of answers we get, which
        itâ€™s lower than what we expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, this survey, with all of this, WeasyPrint not depending about
        it anymore, led us to this decision (the suspense is over).
      </p>
      <p>
        Weâ€™ll continue to release CairoSVG versions to support new Python
        versions ðŸŽ‰.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weâ€™ll continue to release CairoSVG versions in case of security
        issue (like it has been the case for CairoSVG 2.5.1) ðŸŽ‰.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the development of new features or bug fixes will have to be paid for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thatâ€™s it! Thanks for your attention and if youâ€™d like to have
        new features or bug fixes in CairoSVG, you can <a href="mailto:contact@courtbouillon.org">send us a mail</a>.
