      <h2>The Future of CairoSVG</h2>
      <aside><time datetime="2022-05-19">May 19, 2022</time>, by grewn0uille</aside>
      <p>
        After some times of doubts and questioning about the future of CairoSVG, we made
        a survey to know what the current users would like and expect.
        This article presents the results of this survey and what is coming for CairoSVG.
      </p>

      <h3>Why a Survey?</h3>

      <p>
        For a long time, CairoSVG has been used by WeasyPrint when it was relying
        on cairo to render SVG, PNG and PDF. Cairo is nice but it brought some
        limitations and bugs in WeasyPrint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of these bugs and limitations, we removed this dependency from
        WeasyPrint by developing our own <a href="{{ url_for('blog', article='000008-weasyprint-53-beta') }}">low-level PDF engine</a>.
        Most of CairoSVGâ€™s code was then adapted to work with this new engine
        and was included into WeasyPrint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this big change, we didnâ€™t really use CairoSVG anymore, and it was
        thus hard for us know where to lead this project or what would be nice
        to have when using CairoSVG.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could have some ideas by looking at the issues on GitHub, but it didnâ€™t
        really reflect the majority of users. Thus, we decided to made a survey to
        ask directly these users ðŸ”Ž.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, which answers did we get from this survey?
      </p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <h4>How long have you been using CairoSVG?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q1.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        CairoSVG was a dependency of WeasyPrint, so itâ€™s not very surprising to
        see that a part of the users have been using it for a long time. Itâ€™s
        more surprising to have recent users as the project didnâ€™t get new
        features since quite a time.
      </p>

      <h4>In which context do you use CairoSVG?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q2.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Most people use CairoSVG in a professional context, but itâ€™s
        interesting to see that some are using it in a personal context too.
      </p>

      <h4>Why did you choose to use CairoSVG, compared to other SVG conversion libraries?</h4>
      <p>
        Users like to use CairoSVG because itâ€™s fast, open source and easy to
        use. You can have a good control on what youâ€™re doing.
      </p>

      <h4>In which format do you convert your SVG images with CairoSVG?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q3.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Itâ€™s funny to see that a large part of the users are using CairoSVG to
        convert SVG into SVG. This feature had been developed as a joke as the
        original goal of CairoSVG is to convert SVG into other formats ðŸ˜„.
      </p>

      <h4>On which OS do you use CairoSVG?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q4.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Linux is the main OS on which CairoSVG is used, but there is a
        significant part on Windows too.
      </p>

      <h4>What would you expect from CairoSVG in the future?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q5.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        The majority of the users expects bug fixes for CairoSVG. Itâ€™s also
        quite interesting to see that some people expect nothing in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the comments, CairoSVG users would also like to see CairoSVG
        maintained with recent Python versions and have a long life.
      </p>

      <h4>Would you like to use another library?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q6.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Most people arenâ€™t really into using something else than CairoSVG, but
        some are willing to try something else.
      </p>

      <h4>Would WeasyPrintâ€¯+â€¯GhostScript be a solution for you?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q7.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        The answer is kind of clear, WeasyPrintâ€¯+â€¯Ghostscript wouldnâ€™t be
        a solution to replace the usage of CairoSVG.
      </p>

      <h4>Would you be ready to pay for new features or bug fixes?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/cairosvg_q8.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Only 12.5% would be ready to pay for new features or bug fixes.
        While 75% wouldnâ€™t like that.
      </p>

      <h3>Whatâ€™s Next</h3>

      <p>
        First, weâ€™d like to thank all the people who took some time to answer
        the survey ðŸ’œ. It really helped us to have a clearer view and to take a
        decision about what weâ€™re going to do for the future of CairoSVG.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before talking about the future (so much suspense), weâ€™d like to
        talk a bit more of this survey itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we created it and looked for CairoSVG issues on GitHub to
        communicate about the survey, we realized that, in fact, there arenâ€™t
        so many new issues. The more recent ones are from 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were also surprised by the number of answers we got, which
        is lower than what we expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, with the results of the survey, with the number of open
        issues, and knowing that WeasyPrint doesnâ€™t depend on CairoSVG anymore,
        we took these decisions (the suspense is over):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Weâ€™ll continue to release CairoSVG versions to support new Python
          versions ðŸŽ‰.
        </li>
        <li>
          Weâ€™ll continue to release CairoSVG versions in case of security
          issues (as it was the case for CairoSVG 2.5.1) ðŸŽ‰.
        </li>
        <li>
          Weâ€™ll include pull requests for obvious bug fixes, but weâ€™ll be very
          conservative with pull requests for new features. We wonâ€™t develop
          new features, unless some users are willing to sponsor their
          development.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This way, with our limited resources, weâ€™ll be able to keep providing
        the current experience for the current CairoSVG users, and they can be
        assured that project will be maintained and will keep working in the
        future ðŸš€.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thatâ€™s all, thanks for your attention!
