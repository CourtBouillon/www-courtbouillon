      <h3>Grid Layout</h3>

      <p>
        After being a most-wanted feature for quite a time, always on top positions
        in our annual survey, with a lot of thumbs up on its GitHub issue,
        <strong>Grid layout</strong> is now supported in
        <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/releases/tag/v62.0">WeasyPrint v62</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Grid layout support has been added thanks to the financial
          support of a nice anonymous company. It‚Äôs been a real
          pleasure to work with them üòç.
        </em>
      </p>

      <h4>What Can I Use?</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>All the Grid properties are supported by WeasyPrint</strong> and can
        be used to style your documents üéâ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, you can also use margins, padding and borders on Grid
        containers and Grid items, and fragmentation between rows is
        handled.
      </p>

      <h4>Limitations</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>This implementation of Grid in WeasyPrint is a (big) first step
          for Grid support</strong>, and some values and use cases aren‚Äôt fully
        supported yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full list of supported / unsupported Grid features is
        available <a href="https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/api_reference.html#css-grid-layout-module-level-2">in the documentation</a>.
        Don‚Äôt hesitate to have a look!

      <h3>CSS Nesting</h3>

      <p>
        Another nice feature has been added to WeasyPrint: <strong>CSS nesting!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When writing CSS, you often need to repeat selectors, and
        stylesheets can easily become not very pleasant to read.  To
        avoid that, you could use a CSS generator, like SASS, to
        nest CSS selectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with CSS nesting, you can now do that directly in pure
        CSS ü§Ø. <strong>Let‚Äôs say hi to nested rules and <code>&amp;</code> selector.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if you want to set a color on a section and then
        a different color for ul in this section, usually you write
        something like:
      </p>

      {{ '00051-without-nesting.css' | pygmentize }}

      <p>
        With CSS nesting, you can now write:
      </p>

      {{ '00051-with-nesting.css' | pygmentize }}

      <p>
        The <code>&amp;</code> selector allows to select the parent. For
        example, if you want your sections to be pink, except when they‚Äôre in
        an article, you can write:
      </p>

      {{ '00051-without-selector.css' | pygmentize }}

      <p>
        With the <code>&amp;</code> selector, you can now write:
      </p>

      {{ '00051-with-selector.css' | pygmentize }}

      <p>
        <strong>CSS nesting will certainly simplify your stylesheets!</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>More Features and Bug Fixes</h3>

      <p>
        This version comes with other nice features:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>border-image-*</code> support: you can now <strong>use images
            for box borders to have fancy borders</strong>. You can even use
          gradients!
        </li>
        <li>
          form field limit: you can set the <code>maxlength</code> HTML
          attribute on form inputs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Font management has also been improved: fonts aren‚Äôt duplicated anymore
        in memory, saving a lot of RAM in some cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Several other bugs have been fixed, you can find the full list in
        the <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/releases/tag/v62.0">changelog</a>.
