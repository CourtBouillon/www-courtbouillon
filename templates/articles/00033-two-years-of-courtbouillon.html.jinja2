      <h3>A Brief Introduction</h3>

      <p>
        For this 2-year anniversary, <strong>we made a short survey about you, WeasyPrint and
        your expectations</strong>. Thanks a lot to all the people who answered it üíú.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this article, we‚Äôre going to briefly introduce ourselves for people who
        don‚Äôt know us yet, remember what happened during this year, detail our
        sources of income and then see what we‚Äôre up to for the next year!
      </p>

      <h4>Who Is CourtBouillon?</h4>

      <p>
        Two years ago, we announced the creation of CourtBouillon.
      </p>
      <p>
        We? We are Guillaume, aka <code><a href="https://github.com/liZe">liZe</a></code>,
        and Lucie, aka <code><a href="https://github.com/grewn0uille">grewn0uille</a></code> üëã.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h4>What Does CourtBouillon Do?</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Our goal, as CourtBouillon, is to develop and maintain open source software.</strong>
        The main projects we take care of are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>WeasyPrint,</li>
        <li>pydyf,</li>
        <li>tinycss2,</li>
        <li>Pyphen,</li>
        <li>cssselect2,</li>
        <li><a href="{{ url_for('page', page='projects') }}">and more‚Ä¶</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Beyond maintaining and developing this nice software, we also love to write
        articles on this blog about new WeasyPrint versions, specific new features,
        CSS tricks, technical topics‚Ä¶
      </p>

      <p>

      <h3>Sources of Income</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>All these things wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without sponsors, backers and users.</strong>
        Thanks a lot üíú.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we believe that transparency is important, we‚Äôre going to provide
        details on our different sources of income.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have four main sources of income:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>templating and styling with HTML/CSS,</li>
        <li>bug fixes and additional features,</li>
        <li>sponsoring and donations on <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">OpenCollective</a>,</li>
        <li>miscellaneous, which will be detailed.</li>
      </ul>

      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/2_year_incomes.svg') }}" />

      <p>
        The distribution between the different sources is quite homogeneous.
      </p>

      <h4>Templating and styling with HTML/CSS</h4>
      <p>
        If you didn‚Äôt know yet, <strong>we offer professional support,</strong>
        mainly on WeasyPrint and its usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Creating HTML and CSS for print is one of the (many) things we can do.</strong>
        If you have a cute mock-up for your documents made by your sweet
        designer, if you don‚Äôt know how to transform it into nice HTML/CSS (or
        don‚Äôt have the time to do it), we‚Äôre here for you!
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS can sometimes be hard to master, even more when it‚Äôs CSS for print.
        Our long experience on this topic gives us the skills to create
        reliable HTML and CSS quickly. Reading our CSS is also a simple way for
        our clients to learn how to write their future stylesheets.
      </p>

      <h4>Bug Fixes and Additional Features</h4>
      <p>
        Another thing that we can do is <strong>to fix the bugs that make your
        life hard</strong> and <strong>to add the features you need to generate
        the greatest documents of all time.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        A nice thing about this part is that the bug fixes and the new features you
        sponsor benefit the whole community. Another nice thing is that the bug
        fixes and the new features funded by other companies will be useful for you
        üòâ!
      </p>
      <p>
        During this year, some nice features and bug fixes have been funded by
        sponsors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>footnotes support,</li>
        <li>PDF/A support,</li>
        <li>bitmap fonts support,</li>
        <li>nested <code>line-clamp</code> support,</li>
        <li>better footnotes support for multicolumn layouts,</li>
        <li>and more are coming!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Thanks a lot to everyone who sponsored features and bug fixes üíú.</strong>
      </p>

      <h4>Sponsoring and Donations on OpenCollective</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>When <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">you become a
        backer or a sponsor on OpenCollective</a>, you greatly help
        CourtBouillon to maintain its projects in a sustainable way.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, fixing bugs and adding features requires a lot of time. But
        there is also a lot of invisible work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Answering and sorting GitHub issues, improving tests, improving performance,
        writing articles, communicating ‚Ä¶ all these things require time.
        Thanks to <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">OpenCollective backers and sponsors</a>,
        we‚Äôre able to spend time to do that peacefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Thanks to all the OpenCollective backers and sponsors üíú.</strong>
      </p>

      <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
      <p>
        As you can guess, this category contains everything that doesn‚Äôt fit in
        the other categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year, it includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>helping packaging <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a> for Windows,</li>
        <li>automating document generation with WeasyPrint,</li>
        <li>advising on best practices for print CSS,</li>
        <li>developing a <a href="https://radicale.org/">Radicale</a> plugin.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What for Next Year?</h3>

      <p>
        After this year, what can you expect for the next one?
      </p>

      <h4>New Features</h4>
      <p>
        In the survey, we asked you which features you‚Äôd like to see in WeasyPrint.
        Here are the results!
      </p>

      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/2_year_next_features.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        The battle has been tough between faster generation and grid
        support!
      </p>

      <p>
        This ranking doesn‚Äôt contain all the GitHub issues with the <code>feature</code> label.
        It doesn‚Äôt mean that everything here will be done, but it will
        definitely help us prioritize the roadmap üõ£Ô∏è.
      </p>

      <h4>New Articles</h4>
      <p>
        We think that communication is important, so that everyone can be
        up-to-date regarding the software we maintain. It‚Äôs also nice to share
        some knowledge about CSS, printed documents, Python, and all the other
        cool subjects we‚Äôre sure we‚Äôll cover in the future!
      </p>
      <p>
        So, you can expect new articles about features, WeasyPrint versions,
        CSS tricks, and more!
      </p>

      <h4>And More!</h4>
      <p>
        Of course, you can be sure we‚Äôll continue to answer all the GitHub
        issues you may open, all the mails you may send us, all the messages
        you may write on our Matrix/Gitter channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You can be sure we‚Äôll do our best to offer WeasyPrint and its
        dependencies a bright future.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks again to all the people who sponsored features and bug fixes, to
        our lovely backers and sponsors, to our fantastic clients, to everyone
        who uses our software and opens issues üíú.
