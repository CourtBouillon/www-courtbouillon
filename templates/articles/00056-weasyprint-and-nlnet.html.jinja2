        Beginning of this year, WeasyPrint <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/Weasyprint/">has been selected</a> by NLnet to receive a NGI Zero grant.
        What is NLnet? What is a NGI Zero grant? How this is helping WeasyPrint?

      <h3>What is the NLnet Foundation?</h3>
      
      <p>
        Created in the 80â€™s, the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLnet Foundation</a> is a non-profit organization
        who worked a lot on the the European Unix network and the commercial and public internet network provision in the Netherlands.
        They also also pioneered the worlds first dial-in and ISDN infrastructure with full country coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, the Foundation aims to create a better, safer and more secure internet and
        they support independent people and organizations contributing to the open information society.
      </p>
      <p>
        For that, NLnet sponsors open source software and open standards that benefit everyone ðŸ’œ

      <h3>What is a NGI Zero Grant?</h3>

      <p>
        To receive financial support from the Foundation, you have to apply to one
        of <a href="https://nlnet.nl/funding.html">their fundings</a>. So thatâ€™s what we did!
      </p>
      <p>
        We applied to the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/core/">NGI Zero Core Fund</a> (which is currently not available, but other are),
        a fund supported by the European Commission to help creating an open, trust-worthy and reliable internet for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fund about internet open standards and interoperability, a perfect fund for WeasyPrint!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you develop an open source project aligned with the values and mission of the Foundation and need support, donâ€™t hesitate to apply too.
        They try to keep the process as simple as possible so you can focus on your project. And as far as weâ€™re concerned, theyâ€™re pretty good at it ðŸ˜Š

      <h3>How this is helping WeasyPrint?</h3>

      <p>
        With this grant, weâ€™re able focus on different topics that are quite huge and for which we need period of time to work on.
      </p>
      <p>
        These topics are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>improving the flex layout;</li>
        <li>improving PDF/UA support;</li>
        <li>supporting CMYK.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Improving flex layout</h4>
      <p>
        A lot of issues have been opened about flex. Some have been closed with work-arounds, more or less clean, bringing other issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real deal was to have time to rewrite flex layout support in a cleanest way.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can track the progress on this topic, and the linked issues that will be fixed, in the related GitHub issue
        <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/2362">#2362</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Improving PDF/UA support</h4>
      <p>
        Since v57, WeasyPrint is able to generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/UA">PDF/UA</a> documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        PDF/UA is a sub-module of the PDF standard specifying terms and requirements for accessibility in PDF documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The support of PDF/UA in WeasyPrint works well for documents with simple content, but have issues with some structures.
        With the grant, weâ€™ll be able to improve this support and also have time to find a way to more solid tests on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also track the progress on this topic, and the linked issues that will be fixed, in the related GitHub issue
        <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/2363">#2363</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Supporting CMYK</h4>
      <p>
        Adding support of CMYK in WeasyPrint is a long-standing request, the
        <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/1091">related GitHub issue</a> has been opened in 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        CMYK has been specified in CSS Color Level 4 for quite some time, but has been moved into Level 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, WeasyPrint already supports Level 4, so we "just" have to support Level 5 ðŸŒˆ
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For roadmap lovers, each topics will have its own WeasyPrint main version, starting this month with
        WeasyPrint v65.0 and flex layout improvements!
