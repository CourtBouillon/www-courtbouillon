      <p>
        Version 55 of WeasyPrint has been released. The last bugs of the beta
        version have been fixed, it’s time for you to install and enjoy the new
        features of this latest major version.

      <h3>What’s New?</h3>

      <h4>Visible Features</h4>
      <p>
        As explained in the
        <a href="{{ url_for('blog', article='00021-weasyprint-55-beta') }}">previous article</a>,
        WeasyPrint has been improved in different fields:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance</strong>, with improved speed and document size;</li>
        <li><strong>Columns</strong> can be finely managed and are more solid in many corner cases;</li>
        <li><strong>Shorthand properties</strong> handle the <code>inherit</code> value;</li>
        <li><strong>Text decoration</strong> is correctly applied for nested values;</li>
        <li><strong>Embedded fonts</strong> are smaller and have nice names;</li>
        <li><strong>Absolute boxes</strong> are correctly positioned in right-to-left;</li>
        <li><strong>SVG images</strong> got new tests and small fixes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That’s nice, isn’t it?
      </p>

      <h4>Invisible Work</h4>
      <p>
        A lot of work has been done for these features, for sure, but that’s
        only the tip of the iceberg: apart from these visible improvements, we
        tirelessly continue to work on more obscure (but not less important)
        topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tests are a good example of these invisible tasks.</strong> 31
        issues have been closed, but fixing bugs is not enough: we have to test
        fixed cases, so that bugs don’t come back. Non-regression tests are
        really important to have the proof that the bug is actually fixed, and
        to detect future problems that may be involuntary introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have to prevent new bugs from appearing. That’s why we
        regularly add tests to cover more and more corner cases. Finding code
        that’s not covered by test is a good way to find bugs: code that’s
        tested doesn’t necessarily work, but code that’s not tested is
        undoubtedly rotting with time!
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of tests has increased from 1,861 to 1,969 between versions
        54 and 55, but we’re lucid: having more code for tests than for
        WeasyPrint itself (yes, really) doesn’t prevent users from finding bugs!
        However, we also know that this work is important to keep a high
        quality of code and give our users the best experience when they update
        WeasyPrint.

      <h3>What’s Coming Next?</h3>

      <h4>Layout</h4>
      <p>
        Footnotes, rendering speed and smaller PDFs were among
        <a href="{{ url_for('blog', article='00010-weasyprint-survey-2021') }}">the most important topics for your users</a>.
        We have worked on this during the previous versions, but it’s now time
        to work on the number one feature of this survey: grid layout.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Grid layout</strong> has been largely used since its official
        implementation in major browsers in 2017. The possibility to use a
        tabular presentation without using HTML tables is a great improvement
        for layout flexibility and semantic structure of the content, and
        having this feature will greatly help users to use the same layout for
        both their printed documents and their online pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementing the support of the grid layout will take time (and hard
        work, including endless hours reading the specification!), but we think
        that it’s the right moment: we will highly benefit from some the recent
        previous improvements, specifically from the new page-breaking
        possibilities for non-standard layouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        This low-level work on the layout was important to be able to support
        grid, but it also gives nice possibilities for other out-of-the-flow
        layouts. Columns support has been largely improved in version 55 and
        will be improved again in version 56. And columns are not alone:
        <strong>Flexbox support</strong>, that has always been limited,
        <strong>will also be improved</strong> to reach the quality levels we
        want to provide.
      </p>

      <h4>Surprises</h4>
      <p>
        Last but not least: <strong>the next version will also include features
        sponsored by some of our clients.</strong> Which features? That’s a
        surprise, stay tuned!
      </p>
      <p>
        During version 55, many bug fixes and features have been included
        thanks different clients who had specific needs for their projects.
        We’ve been glad to help them designing gorgeous documents and solve
        problems related to paged media. It’s always a pleasure to see that
        these improvements will benefit to all our users. We’re proud of this
        model of collaboration, and we’ll proudly continue to bring the best of
        our skills to companies that share these values.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We also want to thank
        <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon#section-contributors">our sponsors and our bakers</a>:</strong>
