      <h2>WeasyPrint Survey 2021</h2>
      <aside><time datetime="2021-07-12">July 12, 2021</time>, by CourtBouillon</aside>
      <p>
        Our first survey about WeasyPrint‚Äôs users needs is over! Now is the
        time to discover the answers that will influence the future of the
        library.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Why a survey?</h3>

      <p>
        As for many open-source tools, knowing the needs of our users has
        always been complicated. Of course, we can rely on GitHub‚Äôs issues, we
        can discuss while solving problems for our customers, we can spend some
        time on <a href="https://gitter.im/CourtBouillon">our chat</a>, to
        learn what would be useful for the majority of users. But in these
        cases, we only get a small part of the overview.
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, we would like to thank
        <a href="{{ url_for('page', page='index', _anchor='sponsors') }}">our sponsors</a>
        for their support. They give us the time to improve WeasyPrint, for
        their needs and for everybody. We would also like to thank everybody
        who took the time to answer this survey: your answers are precious to
        provide a tool fully adapted to your use cases.
      </p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <h4>How long have you been using WeasyPrint?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/q1.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        WeasyPrint has got a lot of new followers since CourtBouillon‚Äôs birth,
        so it‚Äôs not a surprise to see that most of our users have been using
        WeasyPrint for less than 2 years.
      </p>

      <h4>In which context do you use WeasyPrint?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/q2.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Even if WeasyPrint has been created to solve problems in a professional
        context, it‚Äôs interesting to see that more than 40% use it for personal
        projects.
      </p>

      <h4>Where do you use WeasyPrint?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/q3.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        European countries are well represented in this map, with Germany (17),
        France (10), the Netherlands (4) and the United Kingdom (4) trusting 4
        of the 5 first places. The United States (7) is at the 3<sup>rd</sup> place.
      </p>

      <h4>What kind of documents do you generate?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/q4.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Among the other results, we got resumes, legal and technical documents,
        educational material, books, and much more.
      </p>

      <h4>On which platform do you use WeasyPrint?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/q5.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        If Linux is the main platform, we can see that more than 25% use
        Windows, and more than 20% use macOS. WSL has also been mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various cloud-based solutions have been given in comments too: AWS,
        Lambda, Google Cloud Platform. Containers (mainly Docker) are also
        largely used.
      </p>

      <h4>What are the main difficulties you have with WeasyPrint?</h4>
      <p>
        Reported difficulties are very diversified, but some problems have been
        mentioned more than once:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>missing modern CSS features,</li>
        <li>performance and memory problems,</li>
        <li>no easy debugging solutions,</li>
        <li>installation and dependencies management,</li>
        <li>SVG support,</li>
        <li>right-to-left and vertical text‚Ä¶</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Which features would you like to have in WeasyPrint?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/q7.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        The first two places are taken by two long-awaited features: grid
        layout and footnotes support. No surprise about that, a lot of users
        had already upvoted the corresponding issues!
      </p>
      <p>
        Performance is also very important for our users: faster generation and
        smaller PDFs take the third and fourth places of this epic battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Geospatial PDF and iframes aren‚Äôt really popular and close the pack üö≤,
        just behind right-to-left support (with a surprising low mark).
      </p>

      <h4>Do you know our OpenCollective campaign?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/q8.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        Almost 75% of our users are already supporting us, or are willing to.
        That‚Äôs heartwarming üíñ!
      </p>
      <p>
        All this support gives us a lot of courage to give WeasyPrint all the
        love it deserves. Having financial support gives us more and more time
        to improve the tool and its dependencies, and to make it closer to your
        dreams ü™Ñ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don‚Äôt hesitate to support us on
        <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">OpenCollective</a> üòâ.
      </p>

      <h4>How do you follow WeasyPrint news?</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/q9.svg') }}" />
      <p>
        A lot of our users follow us, mainly on GitHub. Don‚Äôt hesitate to
        follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/BouillonCourt">Twitter</a> and
        to subscribe to
        <a href="https://www.courtbouillon.org/blog.rss">CourtBouillon‚Äôs RSS feed</a>,
        so that you can‚Äôt miss anything when we have good news about our
        projects!
      </p>

      <h4>Do you have any comments?</h4>
      <p>
        A lot of comments are very supportive, we are really grateful for all
        your nice words‚Ä¶
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the various remarks, adding or improving the support of some
        features (grid, flexbox, multicolumn, SVG‚Ä¶) seems to be the most
        important topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, for the people interested in some advice to convince their
        company to support WeasyPrint: having a lot of companies giving a small
        amount of money is the best way to ensure that the project will be
        correctly maintained. Other tools exist, but they‚Äôre often more
        expensive. Having an open source library gives you the freedom to
        change it if needed, and not to be locked in with a specific vendor.
        And, of course, helping nice developers with a great community is a
        good way to make the world a better place üåç üòª.

      <h3>What‚Äôs Next</h3>

      <p>
        As you can imagine, the next features will be the support of Grid and
        footnotes. If everything goes well (it always does), this feature
        should be included with nice improvements of overall layout, including
        improved Flexbox support and
        <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/36">long-awaited parallel flows</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks a lot to our sponsors, who help us to improve WeasyPrint. We
        spend more and more time developing new features and fixing bugs, and
        we hope that we‚Äôll be able to increase this time in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks a lot too to the people who support us, and to those who intend
        to do so. Don‚Äôt hesitate to contribute to our
        <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">OpenCollective campaign</a>,
        to get support and sponsoring logos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version 53 will be released before the end of the month, with a lot of
        new features. Try the
        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/weasyprint/53.0b2/">latest beta version</a>
        to be sure that everything will be fine for you!
