      <h2>CSS Tricks: <code>margin</code></h2>

        You probably already noticed that books are made of pages. And you probably already
        noticed that there are two kinds of pages: rectos and versos. But, did you notice
        that it causes the layout of these pages to be slightly different?
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <figure>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00036-margin.png') }}" alt="Left and right pages with different page margins" title="A left and a right page" />
        <figcaption>
          A left and a right page
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Many books define different layouts for their pages depending on their side: we
        generally want the margins to be larger on the outside, so that our fingers can
        handle the pages without recovering the text. We also want the page numbers to
        be on the outside, making our lives easier when we want to reach a specific page quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        CSS gives a way to define different page layouts for left and right pages:
      </p>

      {{ '00036-margins.css' | pygmentize }}

      <p>
        Page margins are divided into many small areas where you can put the
        content you want: page numbers, current chapter title, fancy footersâ€¦
        These areas have nice default vertical and horizontal alignments, but
        you can of course change them if you really want to.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00036-margin-boxes.png') }}" alt="Margin boxes scheme" title="Margin boxes scheme" />
        <figcaption>
          Margin boxes scheme
        </figcaption>
