      <h3>What is <code>leader()</code> and how to use it?</h3>
      <p>
      A leader is a repeating pattern used to visually connect content across
      horizontal spaces, like in tables of contents for example.
      </p>
      <img alt="Example of leaders in a table of contents" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00007-leaders-1.png') }}" />
      <p>
      The function <code>leader()</code> is a possible value of the
      <code>content</code> property and creates leaders. You can have "."
      leaders, "_" leaders, " " leaders or any string you want as
      leader!
      </p>
      <p>
      Using this function replaces the <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/247#issuecomment-617292724">hack</a>
      which consists in adding dots manually in the content property.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitations and testing</h3>
      <p>
      There are currently some limitations. Indeed, the behaviour of
      <code>leader()</code> may be undefined when the width
      is not defined, or the leader string is larger than the box or if there
      are several leaders for the same line.
      </p>
      <p>
      As long as the containing box width is defined, <code>leader()</code>
      works, even with RTL text:
      </p>
      <img alt="Example of leaders in a table of contents with RTL" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00007-leaders-4.png') }}" />
      <p>
      or with floating elements around:
      </p>
      <img alt="Example of leaders in a table of contents with float element on left side" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00007-leaders-2.png') }}" />
      <img alt="Example of leaders in a table of contents with float element on right side" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00007-leaders-3.png') }}" />
      <p>
      The <code>leader()</code> feature has been developed exclusively for the
      pydyf version and wonâ€™t be backported to the Cairo version. Thatâ€™s a
      good reason to give a try to the <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/tree/master">master branch</a>
      if not already done ðŸ˜‰.
