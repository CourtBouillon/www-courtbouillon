      You may have noticed some sponsoring and donation links pointing to an 
      <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">
      Open Collective page</a>. What is Open Collective? Why become a sponsor or make a donation?

      <h3>What is Open Collective and why we choose it?</h3>
      <p>
      Open Collective is a platform allowing people to create groups (ie. Collectives ðŸ˜‰), helping them to collect money more easily and so people can develop their projects.
      </p>
      <p>
      Other services like Open Collective exist, like Patreon for example. But Open Collective is open-oriented and seems to value transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
      Indeed, Open Collective relies on open source technologies and its source code is available on 
      <a href="https://github.com/opencollective">GitHub</a>. It looks like to be a nice platform with values we share, so we chose Open Collective to manage sponsoring and donations for our projects!
      </p>

      <h3>Why donate?</h3>
      <p>
       On Open Collective, it is possible to set donation goals (you can see them at the bottom <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">of the page</a>). Donation goals are goals that when you reach them you unlock rewards.
      </p>
      <p>
      Here, for CourtBouillon, the rewards are time we lock to work on our 
      <a href="https://www.courtbouillon.org/projects">different software</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      By locking this time, you are assured that the projects you use are going to be alive. By locking this time, you are assured that the software you use is going to have new features, more issues resolved, better documentationâ€¦
      </p>
      <p>
      For now, we put three donation goals going to half a day per week to two days per week.
      </p>
      <p>
      The higher is unlock, the higher projects will grow ðŸŒ±!
