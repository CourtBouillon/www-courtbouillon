      <h3>How to Use PDF Form feature?</h3>

      <p>
        Since a long time, you can include forms in your HTML documents and gather informations.
        Since a long time, <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/61">"Form/Form Fields"</a>
        issue is opened on the WeasyPrint repository.
      </p>

      <h4>Which inputs are supported?</h4>
      <p>
        WeasyPrint supports text-based <code>input</code>, check-boxes and <code>textarea</code>. Your inputs
        have default value? No problem, they‚Äôll be in your PDF!
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00039-inputs.png') }}" alt="A checkbox, a text input and a textarea" title="Form fields supported by WeasyPrint" />
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As WeasyPrint now supports form fields, default style for form elements has been added.
      </p>

      <h4>How to Activate The Feature?</h4>
      <p>
        To enable this feature, you can use the <code>--pdf-forms</code> option or use the
        <code>appearance</code> CSS property.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>--pdf-forms</code> option will enable all of the form fields of your documents but
        <code>appearance</code> allows you to manage it more finely.
      </p>

      <p>
        When set to <code>auto</code> on a form field, <code>appearance</code> will enable the form feature
        for this field. When set to <code>none</code>, it will disable the form feature.
      </p>
