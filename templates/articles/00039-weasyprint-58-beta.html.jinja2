      <h3>How to Use PDF Form Feature?</h3>

      <p>
        For a long time, it‚Äôs been possible to include forms in your HTML documents and gather information.
        For a long time, the <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/61">"Form/Form Fields"</a>
        issue has been opened in the WeasyPrint repository.
      </p>

      <p>
        This issue is now closed!
      </p>

      <h4>Which Inputs Are Supported?</h4>
      <p>
        WeasyPrint supports text-based <code>input</code> tags, check-boxes and <code>textarea</code> tags. Your inputs
        have default value? No problem, they‚Äôll be in your PDF!
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00039-inputs.png') }}" alt="A checkbox, a text input and a textarea" title="Form fields supported by WeasyPrint" />
        <figcaption>
          Form fields supported by WeasyPrint
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        And now that WeasyPrint supports form fields, a default style for form elements has also been added!
      </p>

      <h4>How to Activate the Feature?</h4>
      <p>
        To enable this feature, you can use the <code>--pdf-forms</code> option or use the
        <code>appearance</code> CSS property. The <code>--pdf-forms</code> option will enable all of the form fields of your documents,
        and the <code>appearance</code> property can manage them more finely.
      </p>

      <p>
        When set to <code>auto</code> on a form field, <code>appearance</code> will generate a PDF form input
        for this field. When set to <code>none</code>, it will disable the PDF form input and display it as normal PDF content.
      </p>
