      <h2>WeasyPrint v54: Beta Time</h2>
      <aside><time datetime="2021-12-16">December 16, 2021</time>, by grewn0uille</aside>
      <p>
      v54 is the next main version of WeasyPrint. A <a href="">beta has been released</a> so you can
      try it and helping us to have a nice stable release!
      This version has new features like footnote support, parallel flows and
      colored emojis. Letâ€™s present these features!
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h3>Footnote Support</h3>
      <p>
      Thanks to <a href="https://www.codeandco.com/">Code & Co.</a> who
      sponsored it, WeasyPrint now supports footnote ðŸŽ‰.
      </p>

      <p>
      Footnote allows you to put some notes at the bottom of a page which let you
      provide comments, citationsâ€¦
      </p>

      <h4>A Footnote Example</h4>
      <p>
      To create a footnote element, <code>float: footnote;</code> is used.
      For example, a footnote statement that looks like this:
      </p>

      {{ '00018-footnotes.html' | pygmentize }}

      <p>gives the following result:</p>
      <img style="width:70%" alt="Example of footnote" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00018-footnote.png') }}" />
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Parallel Flows</h3>

      <p>
      For a long time, elements that arenâ€™t in the normal flow, like float or
      absolute, werenâ€™t cutable. So if a float element was too long for a page,
      only the part fitting on the first page was rendered.
      </p>
      <p>
      But now, with parallel flows, when a page break appears, we can know
      where we stop to render these elements which arenâ€™t in the flow and
      fully display them on several pages.
      </p>

      <h4>A Parallel Flow Example</h4>
      <p>
      As an example is better than a lot of words, letâ€™s see what happens with
      WeasyPrint v53.4 and WeasyPrint v54-beta on this sample:
      </p>

      {{ '00018-parallel-flows.html' | pygmentize }}

      <figure>
        <img alt="Example of parallel flow issue with WeasyPrint v53.4" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00018-parallel-flows-53.png') }}" />
        <img alt="Example of parallel flow with WeasyPrint v54-beta" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00018-parallel-flows-54.png') }}" />
        <figcaption>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>And Moreâ€¦</h3>

      <p>
      Other features have been added in this version:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Colored Emojis:
          When we <a href="{{ url_for('blog', article='00009-weasyprint-53-what-s-new') }}">
          replaced cairo by our own PDF generator</a>, we lost support of
          colored emojis. But this time is over, colored emojis are back in the
          game ðŸ¥³!
        </li>
        <li>
          Improvement of <code>overflow-wrap</code>: the property <code>overflow-wrap</code>
          now supports the value <code>anywhere</code>. This may helps you
          dealing with text split.
        </li>
        <li>
          DLLs management for Windows: with Python 3.8, DLL resolution changed.
          You can now specify to WeasyPrint where to look for the DLLs with the
          environment variable <code>WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>What Are the Next Steps?</h3>

      <p>
      The next main step is, of course, to make a real release of this version
      WeasyPrint.
      </p>
      <p>
      But before that, we need you to try this beta and report us the bugs you
      may found ðŸª²!
      </p>
      <p>
      And so, weâ€™ll be able to have a really nice version 54 ðŸ˜Š.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have fun with this <a href="">beta</a> ðŸ’œ.
