      <h2>WeasyPrint v54: Beta Time</h2>
      <aside><time datetime="2021-12-13">December 13, 2021</time>, by grewn0uille</aside>
      <p>
      v54 is the next main version of WeasyPrint. A <a href="">beta has been released</a> so you can
      try it and help us to have a nice stable release!
      This version has new features like footnotes support, parallel flows and
      colored emojis. Letâ€™s present these features!
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h3>Footnote Support</h3>
      <p>
      Thanks to <a href="https://www.codeandco.com/">Code & Co.</a> who
      sponsored it, WeasyPrint now supports footnotes ðŸŽ‰.
      </p>

      <p>
      Footnotes allow you to put some notes at the bottom of a page, which let you
      provide comments, citationsâ€¦
      </p>

      <h4>A Footnote Example</h4>
      <p>
      To create a footnote element, <code>float: footnote</code> is used.
      For example, a footnote statement that looks like this:
      </p>

      {{ '00018-footnotes.html' | pygmentize }}

      <p>gives the following result:</p>
      <img style="width:70%" alt="Example of footnote" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00018-footnote.png') }}" />
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Parallel Flows</h3>

      <p>
      For a long time, elements that arenâ€™t in the normal flow, like floats or
      absolutes, werenâ€™t breakable. So, if a float element was too long for a page,
      only the part fitting on the first page was rendered.
      </p>
      <p>
      But now, with parallel flows, when a page break appears, we can display
      the rest of the float on the next page.
      </p>

      <h4>A Parallel Flow Example</h4>
      <p>
      As an example is better than a lot of words, letâ€™s see what happens with
      WeasyPrint v53.4 and WeasyPrint v54-beta on this sample:
      </p>

      {{ '00018-parallel-flows.html' | pygmentize }}

      <figure>
        <img alt="Example of parallel flow issue with WeasyPrint v53.4" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00018-parallel-flows-53.png') }}" />
        <img alt="Example of parallel flow with WeasyPrint v54-beta" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/00018-parallel-flows-54.png') }}" />
        <figcaption>

      </figure>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>And Moreâ€¦</h3>

      <p>
      Other features have been added in this version:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Colored Emojis:
          When we <a href="{{ url_for('blog', article='00009-weasyprint-53-what-s-new') }}">
          replaced cairo by our own PDF generator</a>, we lost support of
          colored emojis. But this time is over, colored emojis are back in the
          game, including
          <a href="https://github.com/eosrei/twemoji-color-font#what-is-svginot">vector emojis</a> ðŸ¥³!
        </li>
        <li>
          Improvement of <code>overflow-wrap</code>: the <code>overflow-wrap</code> property
          now supports the value <code>anywhere</code>. This may help you
          dealing with text split, in tables for example.
        </li>
        <li>
          DLLs management for Windows: with Python 3.8, DLL resolution changed.
          You can now specify to WeasyPrint where to look for the DLLs with the
          environment variable <code>WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>text-align-all</code> and <code>text-align-last</code>: these
          properties are now supported if you want to justify the last line of
          a paragraph.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Thanks a lot to
        <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/graphs/contributors">our wonderful contributors</a>
        for their hard work on this release ðŸ’œ.

      <h3>What Are the Next Steps?</h3>

      <p>
      The next main step is, of course, to make a real release of this version
      of WeasyPrint.
      </p>
      <p>
      But before that, we need you to try this beta and report bugs you
      may found ðŸª²!
      </p>
      <p>
      Weâ€™ll then be able to have a really nice version 54 ðŸ˜Š.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have fun with this <a href="">beta</a> ðŸ’œ.
