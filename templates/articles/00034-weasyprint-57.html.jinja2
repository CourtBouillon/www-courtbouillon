      <h3>What’s New?</h3>

      <h4>Visible Features</h4>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/releases/tag/v57.0">This stable version</a>
        includes all the changes from
        <a href="{{ url_for('blog', article='00031-weasyprint-57-beta') }}">the beta version</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PDF/UA</strong> documents can now be generated,</li>
        <li><strong>variable fonts</strong> are now supported,</li>
        <li>many bugs of <strong>footnotes in multicolumn layouts</strong> have been fixed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Version 57 also includes many small bug fixes since the beta version,
        with an improved support of fonts, a bug fix for the skew
        transformation, the possibility to attach documents to PDF files with
        anchors, or a better handling of baselines in inline flex elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note also that <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/cssselect2/pull/24">a lot of new CSS selectors</a>
        are available in the latest versions of cssselect2 released in 2022.
        Don’t forget to update this library to get the possibility to put these
        very useful selectors in your stylesheets!

      <h4>Invisible Work</h4>
      <p>
        As always, our work on WeasyPrint includes a lot of less visible but
        critical tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Among these tasks, packaging is a very important one.</strong> We’ve spent
        <a href="{{ url_for('blog', article='00011-the-python-packaging-hell-the-can-of-worms') }}">a lot of time</a>
        to get a nice workflow to easily generate our
        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/weasyprint/">source and wheel packages on PyPI</a>,
        so that <code>pip install weasyprint</code> works correctly on many
        platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linux is not the only platform where WeasyPrint is packaged: you can
        now easily install WeasyPrint with
        <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/weasyprint">Homebrew on macOS 🍎</a>
        or <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/print/weasyprint">with OpenBSD’s port 🐠</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Packaging takes a lot of time. Python’s packaging ecosystem is
        improving fast, tools change and sometimes things break…
        <strong>It’s important for us to take the time to talk with packagers,</strong>
        even <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/1410">when it’s difficult</a>
        (and that’s not the only example), because they’re the people working
        in the shadows to give everyone the possibility to use software more
        easily. In this release, we had to
        <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/commit/b9c086d">remove the default use of Pytest’s plugins for coverage and linting</a>,
        because of nasty compatibility bugs between Pytest and Pytest-Flake8.
        That’s also a way to improve the packagers’ life, because it avoids
        useless problems with these tools while they’re testing their packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to everyone working around our libraries 🙏, thanks to our
        wonderful contributors 💜, we’ll continue to do our best to make
        WeasyPrint easy to hack, to debug, to package, and of course to use!

      <h3>What’s Coming Next?</h3>

      <h4>Layout</h4>
      <p>
        Our work on Grid and Flex has been delayed so many times 📅… Sorry for
        all the people waiting for these features, we had a lot of work to do
        to please our lovely sponsors 🚀. Let’s hope that version 58 will
        finally bring good news for these topics!
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, if you really want some features to come earlier, <strong>don’t
        hesitate to send a message to share your needs with us,</strong> or to
        <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">become a sponsor on OpenCollective</a>.
        We’ve already had a lot of fun working with big companies on to big
        projects with a lot code 🏭, we love small documents with cute
        handcrafted stylesheets 📑, and we always thank our beloved backers
        when we drink a cup of coffee ☕ or a pint of beer 🍺. <strong>Each
        project and each donation, big or small, is important to keep WeasyPrint working well.</strong>
      </p>

      <h4>Your Turn!</h4>
      <p>
        It’s now your turn to work! Install
        <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/releases/tag/v57.0">version 57</a>
        and give us some feedback.
        <strong>We hope that the different improvements brought by this release will be helpful for you.</strong>
