      <h3>A New Anniversary</h3>

      <p>
        When we started CourtBouillon in 2020 to take care of
        WeasyPrint and its dependencies, it was important to us to be
        transparent about our activities and incomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, as each October 12, for CourtBouillonâ€™s anniversary, we
        prepared a rewind of the year to share with you the main
        things that happenned and what is coming for the next one!
      </p>

      <h3>What Happened This Year?</h3>

      <p>
        Many things occured during this year. First, letâ€™s start with
        some metrics about WeasyPrint and its dependencies. How many
        issues were closed? How many pull requests were merged? How
        many releases have been out?
      </p>

      <h4>Closed Issues</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/4_year_issues.svg') }}" />

      <p>
        During the year, 269 issues have been closed. Itâ€™s <strong>an increase
        of 35% compared to the previous year</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4>Merged Pull Requests</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/4_year_pr.svg') }}" />

      <p>
        63 pull requests have been merged. Itâ€™s also <strong>an increase
        compared to last year ofâ€¦ 53%</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4>Releases</h4>
      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/4_year_releases.svg') }}" />

      <p>
        15 versions have been released!
      </p>

      <p>
        More issues have been closed this year, more pull requests
        have been merged and a bit less of versions have been
        released, but <strong>with more content</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also <strong>thanks a lot to all the contributors and welcome to the
        newcomers</strong> ðŸ’–.
      </p>

      <h4>New Features</h4>

      <p>
        Among all of these releases, indeed there are some
        new cool features and improvements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>grid support,</li>
        <li>CSS nesting,</li>
        <li><code>var()</code> support,</li>
        <li><code>border-image-*</code> properties support,</li>
        <li>PDF/A-?u support,</li>
        <li>select fields in forms,</li>
        <li>Windows executable generation,</li>
        <li>and other thingsâ€¦</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Meeting the community</h3>

      <p>
        During the year, we had the opportunity to go to several
        conferences to <strong>give a talk about living from Free Software</strong> and
        meet some of you in real life:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://jdll.org/">JDLL</a> in Lyon,</li>
        <li>IT Woman by Yeeso meetup in Lyon,</li>
        <li><a href="https://2024.sunny-tech.io/">Sunny Tech</a> in Montpellier,</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.volcamp.io/">Volcamp</a> in Clermont-Ferrand.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It was always in French, but weâ€™ll write an article in
        English, we promise!
      </p>
      <p>
        We also had the chance to participate in a <a href="https://prepostprint.org/">PrePostPrint</a> event
        in Strasbourg. It was very nice to discuss about web-to-print
        usages (and merge some pull requests).
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, meeting some of you in person is really nice and
        led to interesting discussions! So if you see us in some
        events, donâ€™t hesitate to come and say hi ðŸ‘‹!
      </p>

      <h3>Sources of Income</h3>

      <p>
        And here is the part where we talk about money. Like every
        year weâ€™re going to provide details on our different sources
        of income.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have five main sources of income:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>templating and styling with HTML/CSS,</li>
        <li>bug fixes and additional features,</li>
        <li>consulting,</li>
        <li>sponsoring and donations on <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">OpenCollective</a>,</li>
        <li>miscellaneous, which will be detailed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the previous anniversary articles, the consulting part was
        merged with miscellaneous but we thought it makes more sense
        to separate them.
      </p>

      <embed src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphs/4_year_incomes.svg') }}" />

      <p>
        The main sources are templating, consulting and
        miscellaneous. Surprisingly, bugs & features is the smallest.
      </p>

      <h4>Templating and Styling with HTML/CSS</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Creating HTML and CSS for print is one of the services we provide.</strong>
        Itâ€™s very useful when you have a nice mock-up for your
        documents coming from your designer but have some difficulties
        to transform them into HTML/CSS template (or donâ€™t have time to
        do it).
      </p>
      <p>
        During this year, we created several <strong>HTML/CSS templates for differents
        type of documents</strong> like analysis reports, bank
        documents, GDPR related reports, transport and holidays
        roadmapsâ€¦
      </p>

      <h4>Bug Fixes and Additional Features</h4>
      <p>
        Another service we provide is <strong>fixing bugs you encounter and adding new
        features to make your life easier</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A nice thing about this part is that <strong>the bug fixes and the new features you
        sponsor benefit the whole community.</strong> Another nice thing is that <strong>the bug
        fixes and the new features funded by other companies will be useful for you
        ðŸ˜‰!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As said before, this source of income is the smallest this
        year. Only grid layout support and page groups have been sponsored.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Page groups may be a spoiler of the incoming WeasyPrint v63 ðŸ¤«)
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, <strong>thanks a lot to everyone who sponsored features ðŸ’œ.</strong>
      </p>

      <h4>Sponsoring and Donations on OpenCollective</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>When <a href="https://opencollective.com/courtbouillon">you become a
        backer or a sponsor on OpenCollective</a>, you greatly help
        CourtBouillon to maintain its projects in a sustainable way.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The OpenCollective part helps us to do the invisible
        maintenance work, like answering and sorting GitHub issues,
        writing articles, improving performanceâ€¦
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Thanks to all the OpenCollective backers and sponsors ðŸ’œ.</strong>
      </p>

      <h4>Consulting</h4>
      <p>
        This year we decide to get out from the "Miscellaneous"
        category a part of the work that is actually consulting about
        WeasyPrint usage and integration with tools and workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Helping people to have a better experience with WeasyPrint</strong> is
        something we love to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the year, we provided <strong>consulting and advice</strong> about
        upgrading from an old version of WeasyPrint to a more
        recent. We also provided guidance on the architecture of an
        internal documents factory and the creation of a <strong>shared
        HTML/CSS template usable by all users with no need to write CSS
        themselves</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
      <p>
        As you can guess, this category contains everything that doesnâ€™t fit in
        the other categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year, it includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>showcase website development with CRM integration,</li>
        <li>web applications development with document generation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>What for Next Year?</h3>

      <p>
        After this year, what can you expect for the next one?
      </p>

      <h4>Consulting Packages</h4>
      <p>
        After some (a lot?) of "why donâ€™t you provide consulting
        packages? Itâ€™s just one line to add on your website.", "weâ€™d
        like to sponsor you, but our company requires a contract and
        canâ€™t use OpenCollective", or "OK you answered my mails
        everytime, but I want to be sure to have an answer real
        quick", <strong>we decided to create <a href="https://weasyprint.org/#support">WeasyPrint consulting packages</a>!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        These packages get you a number of topics per month about
        WeasyPrint usage, configuration or integration that you can
        discuss with us, by mail or video call.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>These packages are designed for companies for which WeasyPrint
        is critical, and for companies who want to sponsor WeasyPrint but
        canâ€™t use OpenCollective.</strong>
      </p>

      <h4>New Features</h4>
      <p>
        Now <strong>we have a basic solid CSS grid layout support</strong> in WeasyPrint, weâ€™d
        like to <strong>improve it</strong> and add the missing features.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also dream of a <strong>solid flex support</strong> and hope weâ€™ll be able
        to have dedicated time to work on that as the work to be done
        is quite huge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another topic weâ€™d like to <strong>focus on is PDF/UA
        support</strong>. Currently the support is basic and weâ€™d like to have
        something stronger and <strong>make PDF/UA the default PDF format of
        WeasyPrint</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4>And More!</h4>
      <p>
        Of course, weâ€™ll continue to answer all the GitHub issues you
        open, all the mails you send us, all the messages you write on
        our Matrix/Gitter channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You can be sure weâ€™re motivated to do our best to get WeasyPrint and its
        dependencies a shiny future.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks again to all the people who sponsored features and bug fixes, to
        our nice backers and sponsors, to our lovely clients, to our
        sweet contributors, to everyone who uses our software and opens
        issues ðŸ’œ.
