      <h2>WeasyPrint: from Cairo to pydyf</h2>
      <aside><time datetime="2020-12-03">December 3, 2020</time>, by grewn0uille</aside>
      <p>
      We speak a lot about the pydyf branch, but concretely, when will it be
      the master one?
      </p>
    </header>

      <h3>What are we waiting for before using pydyf on master?</h3>
      <p>
      We said that we would get rid of Cairo for WeasyPrint and use pydyf
      instead. And we will.
      </p>
      <p>
      Actually the pydyf branch is working quite well and the tests that donâ€™t
      succeed are mainly those about SVG. At the time this article is written,
      only 5 tests fail (over more than 1450).
      </p>
      <p>
      But to use pydyf on master, we have to look at whatâ€™s happening on the pydyf side.
      </p>

      <h3>What is happening on the pydyf side?</h3>
      <p>
      Our main goal before we use pydyf on the master branch of WeasyPrint isâ€¦
      to release pydyf (what a surprise).
      </p>
      <p>
      For that, we want to have some documentation, tests (we are serious people)
      and a nice packaging.
      </p>
      <p>
      Last week, we published <a href="https://doc.courtbouillon.org/pydyf">the
        documentation</a>, you can have a look if didnâ€™t already ðŸ˜‰.
      </p>
      <p>
      We are currently working on the test part. You can follow the progress on
      the <a href="https://github.com/CourtBouillon/pydyf/actions">pydyf
        repository</a>.

      <h3>When will pydyf be released and used on WeasyPrint?</h3>
      <p>
      We are trying to release pydyf this week-end or next week ðŸ“†.
      </p>
      <p>
      After this release, a last version of WeasyPrint with Cairo will be released
      and the current master branch will be archived.
      </p>
      <p>
      We will soon publish another article to present the differences, and list
      what is missing to make a release with pydyf at this moment.
      </p>
      <p>
      Andâ€¦ the pydyf branch will then be the master one ðŸŽ‰!
