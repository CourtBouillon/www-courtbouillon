      <h2>WeasyPrint: from Cairo to pydyf</h2>
      <aside><time datetime="2020-12-03">December 3, 2020</time>, by grewn0uille</aside>
      <p>
      We speak a lot about the pydyf branch, but concretely, when will pydyf
      branch be the master one?
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h3>What do we wait to use pydyf on master?</h3>
      <p>
      We said we will get rid of Cairo for WeasyPrint and use pydyf instead. 
      And we will.
      </p>
      <p>
      Actually the pydyf branch is working quite well and the tests that donâ€™t
      succeed are mainly those about svg. At the time this article is written,
      only 5 tests fail (over more than 1450).
      </p>
      <p>
      But to use pydyf on master, we have to look on whatâ€™s going on pydyf side.
      </p>

      <h3>What is going on pydyf side?</h3>
      <p>
      Our main goal to use pydyf on the master branch of WeasyPrint isâ€¦ to
      release pydyf (what a surprise).
      </p>
      <p>
      For that we want to have some documentation, tests (we are serious people)
      and a nice packaging.
      </p>
      <p>
      Last week, we published <a href="https://doc.courtbouillon.org/pydyf">the
        documentation</a>, you can have a look if not already done ðŸ˜‰.
      </p>
      <p>
      We are currently working on the test part. You can follow the progress on
      the <a href="https://github.com/CourtBouillon/pydyf/actions">pydyf
        repository</a>.

    <section>
      <h3>When will pydyf be released and used on WeasyPrint?</h3>
      <p>
      We are trying to release pydyf this week-end or next week ðŸ“†.
      </p>
      <p>
      After this release, a last release of WeasyPrint with Cairo will be done
      and the current master branch will be archived.
      </p>
      <p>
      We will publish an article to present the differencies and what is 
      missing to make a release with pydyf at this moment.
      </p>
      <p>
      Andâ€¦ pydyf branch will be the master one ðŸŽ‰!
