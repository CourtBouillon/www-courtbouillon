      <h3>A Lot of Bug Fixes, and Useful New Features</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/releases/tag/v60.0">WeasyPrint version 60</a>
        comes with a lot of bug fixes, and some new features that you may find useful.
      </p>

      <h4>Layout</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Many layout problems have been fixed in this new version,</strong>
        improving our respect of standards and our interoperability with other
        rendering engines.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have for example improved column balancing with spanning
        elements, respected table cells‚Äô minimum sizes, avoided page breaks
        caused by hidden elements, fixed leaders with margins, or improved
        inheritance for named pages.
      </p>

      <h4>Text and Fonts</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Drawing text correctly is complex and requires to take care of a lot of details.</strong>
        In this version, WeasyPrint improves some of them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>correctly draw glyphs with vertical offsets,</li>
        <li>apply text transformation on first letter pseudo elements,</li>
        <li>only draw required glyphs of multi-character SVG fonts,</li>
        <li>support <code>&lt;wbr&gt;</code> tags to add manual line-breaking opportunities,</li>
        <li>adjust text length in SVG using <code>textLength</code> and <code>lengthAdjust</code> attributes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>And More!</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A new <code>--timeout</code> command line option has been added to
          define the maximum amount of time you want to give to your HTTP
          requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Background images are now drawn on PDF‚Äôs bleed area.
        <li>
          Form fields are now displayed when printed on real paper!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Amazing Contributors</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>WeasyPrint is an open source library since its first commit,</strong>
        and we‚Äôre very proud of its hundred contributors so far üíú. But
        we know that working on a HTML/CSS rendering engine may be intimidating
        for newcomers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to get more coders onboard, we tried during this release
        period to give more advice in issues on GitHub. Many tickets have been
        marked as "good first issue" and hints have been added to guide users.
        Contributing is not always easy, but it may be easier than what you
        think!
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, <strong>10 people have contributed code to WeasyPrint v60.0</strong>,
        and that‚Äôs our record so far for a single version ü•≥!
        <strong>Thanks a lot to all the contributors,</strong> many bugs have
        been addressed thanks to your hard work!
